## Unsolved Problems
    "Like" functionality is not fully functional yet, there was difficulty getting likes to connect to posts and comments in the database and persisting the incrementing/decrementing of the values. 

## Future Enhancements
    In the future, I'd like to implement a few more features to make the app come to life: 

    * The ability to "add" or "follow" other users, and have their posts be the posts to populate on the home page. 

    * Add the ability to post videos.

    * Utilize a gif API to allow a gif reaction box at hand for users to reply to posts and comments with. 

    * A messaging feature that allows you to privately message other users.
